Overview
This project provides algorithmic solutions to two computational problems involving arrays and vectors.

Problem 1: Sum of Distinct Elements from Two Sets
Given two arrays representing sets of integers, the algorithm computes the sum of all elements that are unique to either set. That is, it sums elements that appear in exactly one of the two input arrays.

Problem 2: Dot Product and Orthogonality Check of Vectors
This problem includes:

A procedure that computes the dot (scalar) product of two real-valued vectors, using pass-by-reference to store the result.

A function that calculates and returns the dot product of two vectors.

An algorithm that iterates over multiple pairs of vectors and determines whether each pair is orthogonal by checking if their dot product is zero.

Implementation Details
Both problems are expressed in structured pseudocode to facilitate understanding and language-agnostic implementation.

The algorithms employ arrays for representing sets and vectors.

The dot product calculation is demonstrated using two different parameter passing techniques:

Pass-by-reference (procedure)

Return value (function)

Usage
The pseudocode is intended as a guideline for implementing these algorithms in any programming language.

Users may adapt and extend the algorithms to handle inputs of varying sizes and types as needed.

The orthogonality check algorithm prints results indicating whether vector pairs are orthogonal based on the dot product value.
